# Solubility Predictor

## Introduction
This project predicts the solubility of molecules using linear regression. I built a machine learning model that takes physicochemical properties as input and estimates solubility with good accuracy. Itâ€™s useful for chemistry and drug discovery applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/upanyachennoju/SolPredict.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd SolPredict
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Solubility-Predictor-Model.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
3. Tweak hyperparameters if needed for better performance.

## Features
- Predicts molecular solubility using linear regression.
- Uses physicochemical properties as input features.
- Good accuracy thanks to data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
